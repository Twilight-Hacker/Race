Cities

The city is the most important game element.

Creation
To create a city, you need 3 engineer units, 1 advisor, 10 citizen units (representing a population of 10000), and 1 army unit, at the minimum. you may have more citizens and army units if you want.

To increase the city level (range and population capacity) before the countries age you need additional army units equal to the new level, each time. You may construct the city at a higher level right away if you have the army to do so. The increase in level, by itself, costs nothing (but see management, below). During and after countries age, there are no such limitations, and the city level may be decided and increased freely, but doing so may cause other problems (unnessecary polution and wasted resources for example).

The creation cost depends on the starting population and army.
