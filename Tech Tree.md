Technology tree upgrades and effects

Each upgrade has an age (can only be researched during a set age), an IQ requirement that must be met by a race for the advancement to become available, and a research goal, that represents the amount of research required for the discovery.

If an upgrade is added at a later time into the tree, and it belonges to a past age, the discovery is offered for free.

research is split in chains by theme, that may or may not span more than one age

There will be mechanisms to discourage the continuous research of a few chains only

for each age to end and the next to begin, certain requirements must be met that include certain discoveries (not only technological advancements), an amount (not many) of generations in peace or at war, a level of wealth above a limit for some time, and an adundance of food.
