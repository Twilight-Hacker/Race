Trade

There are three trade options

<li>
1 International trade
2 Interplanetary trade
3 Interracial trade
<\li>

The first two forms are not real trade. The analysis follows.

The first form, originally presented as intercity trade, eventually wears down to the exchange of goods between cities and countries. There is no revenuemto be made, but since each city has its own resources, it can prevent problems arising from lack of resources.

The second form, available only after space colonization, generates revenue for each planet at the same amount that the other planet pays. It is actually the equal exchage of commodities between planets.

The third and final form is true trade, and generates revenue. It becomes available during the Space Trade Age. You can actually sell goods to (or buy from) other races.

Trade routes may be set up between cities, belonging on the same or different planets. However, time is needed before the trading vessel can arrive at its destination, and accidents can always happen.
