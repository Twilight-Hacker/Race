Buildings Analysis

All buildings will have certain parameters. 
Upgrades for a parameter become available through tech advancements.
New buildings become available through tech advancements
Some parameters will be building specific
New buildings will utilise all available upgrades with increased cost.

Parameters possesed by All buildings
 Safety: Descreases failure/accident chance. Upgrades may also decrease the maximum failure severity.
 Production type: What it produces (Food:type, Energy:type, Protection, Comfort)
 Production bonus: Bonus offered to the production of the building, without increase in allocation required, as long as the building is operational. Starting at 0.
 Available through: The tech advancement required to make the building available for construction.
 Cost: the cost of the building (in wealth). Increases with new offered upgrades.

Accident can completely destroy a building. At the very least, it creates polution and shuts down for at least 6 months.
Failure shuts it down for a number of weeks equal to its severity. The downtime may be reduced through tech advancements. The higher the building technology (of the available through and the upgrades, other that safety upgrades), the greater the maximum severity of the failure.
Protection actually decreases the death rate (the decrease of the population)
